# Azimuth Talk

An introduction to Azimuth, the Naive Rollup, and how to use it outside of Urbit OS, featuring the up-and-coming GAS software stack.

Azimuth is the blockchain-based Urbit ID system.  It's shrouded in mystery, due to the perplexing "Naive Rollup" system.  But it's actually not that hard, yet very powerful!  I will show how to use it to create Earth-side DNS and E2E encryption, among other interesting applications.



Solid State Interpreter:
- Ethereum
- Sqlite

Naive tutorial

Demo:

1) SQLite schema
2) show tool and snapshot sizes
3) query some ships (state and logs)
4) save a planet's privkey
5) sign a message
6) verify the message

Concepts:

- Naive Rollup extension (attest ETH address, IP address)
- DNS server and spoofing a top-level domain
	- No usernames or passwords
	- No TLS / roundtrips needed
